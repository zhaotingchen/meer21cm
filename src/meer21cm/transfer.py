"""
This module contains the transfer function analysis class and related functions.

In data analysis, you should have already used :class:`meer21cm.power.PowerSpectrum`
to calculate the power spectrum of the data,
or :class:`meer21cm.mock.MockSimulation` to generate the mock data for power spectrum estimation.
In that case, you can pass the :class:`meer21cm.power.PowerSpectrum` or :class:`meer21cm.mock.MockSimulation`
instance as an input to :class:`meer21cm.transfer.TransferFunction`.
The transfer function class then takes into account of the settings of the power spectrum instance,
and perform mock simulations to estimate the numerical transfer function,
keeping the consistency of the gridding, beam, and other settings.

Finally note that, the transfer function calculation supports parallelisation using MPI,
by using :class:`mpi4py.futures.MPIPoolExecutor`.
The default installation of meer21cm does not include ``mpi4py``,
and you need to configure MPI first (usually with openmpi or mpich), and then install ``mpi4py`` manually.

class TransferFunction:
    """
    A class to perform transfer function analysis.

    By default, the transfer function is calculated by generating mock HI signal,
    and perform PCA cleaning by injecting the mock HI signal into the data (unless
    ``R_mat`` is provided, in which case no PCA is performed and R_mat is used to clean the injected data).
    The transfer function is then calculated by dividing the 1D power spectrum of the cleaned data
    by the 1D power spectrum of the mock data. A minimum example running 10 realizations:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> tf = TransferFunction(ps, N_fg=3)
        >>> tf1d_arr = tf.run(range(10), type="auto") # gives you the 1D transfer function with 10 realizations

    If ``type`` is ``"auto"``, the numerator is the **cross-correlation between cleaned HI mock and
    the original HI mock** (and therefore the result is based on HI "auto" power),
    and the denominator is the auto power of the original HI mock.
    If ``type`` is ``"cross"``, the numerator is the cross-correlation between cleaned HI mock
    and galaxy mock, and the denominator is the cross power of the original HI mock and galaxy mock.

    Additionally, if ``type`` is ``"null"``, instead of running transfer function calculation,
    no HI mock is generated, and only mock galaxy data is used to cross-correlate with the map
    data as a null test.

    Parameters
    ----------
        ps: :class:`meer21cm.power.PowerSpectrum`
            The power spectrum instance.
        N_fg: int
            The number of eigenmodes for PCA cleaning.
        R_mat: np.ndarray, default None
            The PCA matrix. If not provided, it will be calculated from the data.
            If provided, no map injection is performed and the cleaning uses this matrix.
        uncleaned_data: np.ndarray, default None
            The uncleaned data, which the mock HI signal is to be injected into.
            If not provided, the mock HI signal is injected into ``ps.data``.
            Note that this can be **wrong** if ``ps.data`` is already overridden by the residual map.
            In that case, you should provide the original map.
        highres_sim: int, default 3
            The mock field will be gridded to a high resolution sky map,
            with the resolution specified by this integer times the pixel resolution, and then
            down-sampled to the pixel resolution.
        upres_transverse: int, default 4
            The mock field is first generated in a rectangular box.
            This is the up-sampling factor of the box comparing to the pixel resolution in the transverse direction.
        upres_radial: int, default 4
            The up-sampling factor in the radial direction comparing to the frequency resolution.
        mean_center_map: bool, default True
            Whether to mean center the map data for PCA cleaning.
        pca_map_weights: np.ndarray, default None
            If mean centering is performed, this is the weights for the mean calculation.
            Also used to weight the data for covariance calculation for PCA eigendecomposition.
        parallel_plane: bool, default True
            Whether to simulate the mock field in the parallel-plane limit (i.e. k_z = k_parallel).
            Only used if ``rsd_from_field`` is True, otherwise parallel-plane is hard-coded to True.
        rsd_from_field: bool, default False
            Whether to generate the RSD effect at field level. If False, the RSD effect is generated at power spectrum level.
        discrete_source_dndz: function, default np.ones_like
            The redshift distribution of the discrete tracer sources.
            Must be a function of redshift.
            Note that the overall number of discrete sources is set to ``ps.ra_gal.size``, so
            only the shape of the dndz is used, not the normalization.
        pool: str, default "multiprocessing"
            The pool to use for parallelisation. Can be "multiprocessing" or "mpi".
        num_process: int, default None
            The number of processes to use for parallelisation.
            If not provided, the number of processes is set to the number of cores available.

        Run the transfer function calculation.

        Note that, ``run`` automatically uses a parallel pool to loop over the ``seed_list``.
        If you believe the parallel behaviour is not as expected,
        you can manually extract the argument list and map the function yourself.
        For example:
        .. code-block:: python

        >>> tf = TransferFunction(ps, N_fg=3)
        >>> tf1d_arr = tf.run(range(10), type="auto")

                The list of seeds for the mock instances.
            type: str, default "cross"
                The type of transfer function calculation to run.

            return_power_3d: bool, default False
                Whether to return the 3D power spectrum of the transfer function.

                The list of results for the transfer function calculation, with

                The first element of each sublist is the transfer function.

                and the third element is the 3D power spectrum of the cleaned mock data.
